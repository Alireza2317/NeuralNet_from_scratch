# Neural Networks Implementation From Scratch
This project focuses on the internal mechanics of the neural networks and the basic concepts like:
- what does actually a neuron do?
- how should weights and biases be organized?
- how to train the network?
- how does backpropagation work?
- and much more ...
  
## Getting Started
The very first step would be to create a virtual enviornment and install all the requirements. You can do so by running these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alireza2317/neuralnet_from_scratch
cd neuralnet_from_scratch
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
now that you have installed all the dependencies, you can start working with the notebooks.
